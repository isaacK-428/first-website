        <p>the definition of a door is a hinged, sliding, or revolving barrier at the entrance to a building, room, or vehicle, or in the framework of a cupboard. everything is revolving becasue of forces like gravity making everything spin like the earth rotating around the sun(and all the atoms in your body spinning). the definition of room is space that can be occupied or where something can be done. Meaning that the empty space between atoms is a room. And all matter can act as barriers meaning that all matter are doors. You are a door I am a door. The sun is a door So bassiclly the only things that arent doors is dark matter and energy which unfortunettly dark matter is a  large portion of the universe.</p>
