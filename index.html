        <p>the definition of a door is a hinged, sliding, or revolving barrier at the entrance to a building, room, or vehicle, or in the framework of a cupboard. everything is revolving becasue of forces like gravity making everything spin like the earth rotating around the sun(and all the atoms in your body spinning). the definition of room is space that can be occupied or where something can be done. Meaning that the empty space between atoms is a room. And all matter can act as barriers meaning that all matter are doors. You are a door I am a door. The sun is a door So bassiclly the only things that arent doors is dark matter and energy which unfortunettly dark matter is a  large portion of the universe.</p>

                <div class = "door">
                  <p>The definition of soup is a liquid food especially with a meat, fish, or vegetable stock as a base and often containing pieces of solid food. the human body has meat in it and plenty of liquids bassiclly anywhere in the body. The definition of food is any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink or that plants absorb in order to maintain life and growth. Which human meat mixed with the liquids inside of it would be a good meal for any animal which has happened in the few cases where animals eat humans or cannaballism. So by this logic actually you are lots of soups with all the meat and liquids in your body making all humans soups<p>
